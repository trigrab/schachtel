# Schachtel

This project is for milling oder lasercutting a schachtel which can hold a predefined number of beers.

## How to use this project

* clone https://github.com/bmsleight/lasercut.git into `./lasercut`
* make sure you have GNU Make and openscad installed
* execute `make`

## before lasercutting/milling everything

This project is unfinished and you have to change the code in `schachtel_output.dxf` a bit. We used dxf2gcode to generate gcode afterwards.
